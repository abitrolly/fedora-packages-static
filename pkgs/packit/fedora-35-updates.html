						<td>Packit Service <user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com> - 0.43.0-1</td>
						<td>- A new `packit prepare-sources` command has been implemented for preparing                                                                                                                                                                 
  sources for an SRPM build using the content of an upstream repository.

- Packit now visibly informs about an ongoing cloning process to remove                                                                                                                                                                     
  potential confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  ([packit#1431](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1431))                                                                                                                                                                               
- The `upstream_package_name` config option is now checked for illegal

						<td>Packit Service <user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com> - 0.42.0-1</td>
						<td>- Running `post-upstream-clone` action in `propose-downstream` command was fixed.
  This solves the issue for projects that generate the specfile during this action.
- New config option `env` has been added for specifying environment variables
  used for running tests in the Testing Farm.</td>

					<tr scope="row">
						<td>2021-11-11</td>
						<td>Packit Service <user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com> - 0.41.0-1</td>
						<td>- Packit now supports `changelog-entry` action that is used when creating
  SRPM. The action is supposed to generate whole changelog entry (including
  the `-` at the start of the lines) and has a priority over any other way we
  modify the changelog with. (#1367)
- Fixed an issue, which raised an `UnicodeEncodingError`, when working with
  dist-git patch files with an encoding other than UTF-8. (#1406)
- Backup alias definitions now reflect the official release of Fedora Linux 35. (#1405)
- We have introduced a new configuration option `merge_pr_in_ci` that allows
  you to disable merging of PR into the base branch before creating SRPM in
  service. (#1395)
- Fixed an issue, where spec-files located in a sub-directory of upstream
  projects, were not placed in the root of the dist-git repo when proposing
  changes downstream. (#1402)</td>

					<tr scope="row">
						<td>2021-10-27</td>
						<td>Packit Service <user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com> - 0.40.0-1</td>
						<td>- Packit will deduce the version for SRPM from the spec file, if there are no git tags or action for acquiring current version defined. (#1388)
- We have introduced new options for generating SRPM packages: (#1396)
  - `--no-bump` that prevents changing of the release in the SRPM, which can be used for creating SRPMs on checked out tags/releases.
  - `--release-suffix` that allows you to customize the suffix after the release number, e.g. reference bugzilla or specific branch of the build.</td>

					<tr scope="row">
						<td>2021-10-14</td>
						<td>Packit Service <user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com> - 0.39.0-1</td>
						<td>- Bug in Packit causing issues with local build when the branch was named with prefix rpm has been fixed. (#1380)
- We have added a new option to Packit CLI when creating Bodhi updates, you can use `-b` or `--resolve-bugzillas` and specify IDs (separated by comma, e.g. `-b 1` or `-b 1,2,3`) of bugzillas that are being closed by the update. (#1383)</td>

					<tr scope="row">
						<td>2021-09-30</td>
						<td>Packit Service <user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com> - 0.38.0-1</td>
						<td>- `packit validate-config` was updated to check if files to be synced
  downstream are present in the upstream repo and emit a warning in case they
  are missing. (#1366)
- Patch files are read as byte streams now, in order to support having
  non-UTF-8 characters. (#1372)</td>

					<tr scope="row">
						<td>2021-09-17</td>
						<td>Packit Service <user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com> - 0.37.0-1</td>
						<td>- `packit source-git` init was updated to try to apply patches with `git am` first, and use `patch` only when this fails, in order to keep the commit message of Git-formatted (mbox) patch files in the source-git history. (#1358)
- Packit now provides `PACKIT_RPMSPEC_RELEASE` environment variable in actions. (#1363)</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr scope="row">
						<td>2021-09-01</td>
						<td>Jiri Popelka <jpopelka at redhat dot com> - 0.36.0-1</td>
						<td>- `status` command has been refactored and now provides much cleaner output. (#1329)
- A log warning is raised if the specfile specified by the user in the config doesn't exist. (#1342)
- Packit by default locally merges checked out pull requests into target branch. Logging for checking out pull requests was improved to contain hashes and summaries of last commit on both source and target branches. (#1344)
- `source-git update-dist-git` now supports using Git trailers to define patch metadata, which will control how patches are generated and added to the spec-file. `source-git init` uses this format to capture patch metadata when setting up a source-git repo, instead of the YAML one. To maintain backwards compatibility, the YAML format is still parsed, but only if none of the patches defines metadata using Git trailers. (#1336)
- Fixed a bug that caused purging or syncing upstream changelog (when not configured) from specfile when running `propose-downstream`. New behavior preserves downstream changelog and in case there are either no entries or no %changelog section present, it is created with a new entry. (#1349)</td>

					<tr scope="row">
						<td>2021-08-09</td>
						<td>Tomas Tomecek <ttomecek at redhat dot com> - 0.35.0-1</td>
						<td>- Propose-downstream: log when a PR already exists downstream (#1322).
- `packit init` to set spec file path in the config if it's not defined (#1313).
- Make it possible to clone packages from staging dist-git (#1306).
- Source-git: squash patches by patch name - no need to have a dedicated attribute, `squash_commits`, for that (#1309).
- Source-git: look for the config file in .distro/source-git.yaml as well (#1302).
- Source-git: change logging from error to warning when %prep is not using setup (#1317).</td>
