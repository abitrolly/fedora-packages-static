# fedora-packages-static

This project intends to replace the current Fedora [packages
app](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/) which is built atop now dead
librairies and a pain to maintain. See *[The packages app has a short
runway](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/infrastructure@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/WWQG4RE5PSR5I2GND5SVWGMZRJNVRRPS/)*
for context.

The idea here is to generate a static page for every package and index it using
an independent tool such as [Yacy](https://yacy.net/).

With the exception of the MIT `assets/css/bootstrap.min.css`, the content of
